# Voxel Game
This is a very early development of a "voxel based Animal Crossing" sandbox game.

# Things of Importance
- Project version: 3.4.4

  You will have to compile the Rust crates for world generation, easy build scripts are provided!


# Todo
- Seperate chunk generation on seperate threads<br>
  *Note: This may not even be nessecary now with Rust's speed (virtualy no hang time, but is still here to think about!)*
- Server and Client (Multiplayer)
- Proper player (Inventory, Health, Etc.)
