# Voxel Game
This is a very early development of a "voxel based Animal Crossing" sandbox game.

# Things of Importance
- Project version: 3.4.4
- C++ bindings version: 3.4.3

  You will have to compile the Godot-CPP and then the chunk generation library.
  An easy build script is provided though!

# Todo
- ~~Port voxel generation to C++~~
- Seperate chunk generation on seperate threads
- Server and Client (Multiplayer)
- Proper player (Inventory, Health, Etc.)
